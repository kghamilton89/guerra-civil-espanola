## Features

Overhaul of Spain to improve gameplay and historical accuracy during the Spanish Civil War in [Hearts of Iron IV](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Hearts_of_Iron_4_Wiki).

### Scenarios

#### The Birth of the Second Republic - September 12, 1931

![](./images/scenario-images/select_date_1936.png)

The Spanish Constitution of 1931 is signed. King Alfonso XIII has abdicated and fled to France. Manuel Azaña Díaz has been given control of a minority government with the desperate goal of securing the fledging Republic.

#### A House of Cards - January 1, 1936

![](./images/scenario-images/select_date_1939.png)

The 1936 elections are a month and a half away. Manuel Azaña Díaz still holds the reigns of power but only just. Leftist populism is at a fever pitch and the military is considering their own intervention.

### Interface

#### Historical Flags and Leaders

Although [Partido Comunista de España](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain) was the largest faction of the [Popular Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(Spain)), the Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista (POUM) is the Communist faction in this mod. This is both a historical and aesthetic decision. POUM was responsible for more military action than the PCE, and POUM forces included extreme leftist factions such as anarchist fighters from the [Confederación Nacional del Trabajo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo#The_Civil_War). POUM divisions were attacked repeatedly by temporary coalitions of PCE and Falangist forces.

### Gameplay
  
* [Generic National Focus Tree](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Generic_national_focus_tree) replaced with historic events:
  * Empower Anarchists to radically increase Communist support at the expense of factory output.
  * Optimize the Francoist military-industrial complex to launch an offensive war upon victory in Spain.
  * Supress dissent to trade manpower for National Unity as either the Facist or Communist government.
  * Reignite [pennisular war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War) goals against Portugal regardless of allegiance.
  * Choose the third option: Stage a democratic uprising after the Civil War.
* World War II participation is historical, joining a belligerent faction results in a declaration of war and invasion.
* War continues until you secure control of the state.
* Historical national advisors:
  * [Manuel Hedilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Hedilla): Increases Facist support, decreases national unity.
  * [Lluís Companys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llu%C3%ADs_Companys): More radically increases democratic support, but executed and removed after the war.
